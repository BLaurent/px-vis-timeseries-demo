## Predix UI px-vis-timeseries demo

This is a demo of px-vis-timeseries component running in a standalone app. 

We've provided a basic setup of a timeseries chart for you to get started with.  The basic demo includes two datasets, loaded asynchronously, and a minimal instantiation of the timeseries component which you can configure. 

This Glitch is a fully functional app, allowing you to configure the timeseries component in public/app/timeseries-demo.html, add your own data to the chart, change the version of the chart being installed in bower.json, and install other components via the bower.json so you can experiment with tying them to the timeseries chart. This is a great way for you to experiement with the features and configuration of the chart, as well as reproduce bugs for the Predix UI team to investigate.
